## Executive Overview:
Superstore, a fictional retail company based in the United States, specializes in furniture, office supplies, and technology products. As a Business Intelligence Analyst hired for the summer at their Seattle office, my role is to identify business weaknesses and opportunities, ultimately contributing to enhancing business growth and profitability.

## Business Questions:

Are there frequently bought-together products?
Which customer segment brings in the most profit?
What is the preferred shipping mode among customers?
How has the company's performance trended over recent months, and what are the key performance indicators (KPIs)?

## KPIs:
Over the past four years, Superstore generated $2.3 million in revenue with a gross profit of $286.41K. The average discount of 15.62% suggests an influence on profit margin, explored further in the Financial Analysis dashboard.

## Sales by Region and State:
The West region led in revenue with $725K, followed by the East region with $678K.
Top contributing states were California, Washington, and New York. Marketing efforts and inventory optimization should focus on these states.

## Sales vs. Profit by Category and Sub-Category:
Technology emerged as the leading performer in both sales and profit, with Phones as a standout sub-category.
Furniture showed significant sales but lower profit margin, with Tables operating at a loss. Concerns about cost structure or pricing strategy arise for Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies.

## Customer Segments and Preferences:
Consumer segment is the largest; targeted marketing can increase sales. Corporate and Home Office segments offer growth opportunities.
Most customers prefer Standard Class shipping, prioritizing cost savings over speed.
